**Module 1: Employment & Job Development**  
  
This module will equip job coaches with a better understanding of the concept and practices of supported employment, the employment landscape in Singapore and the employment laws and grants available for employers and persons with disabilities. It will also cover the role of a job coach and ways to provide guidance to clients with disabilities.  
  
**Module 2: Working with Clients with Different Types of Disabilities**  
  
This module will help job coaches develop a better understanding of clients with different types of disabilities and the challenges that they face as a result of their disabilities. Learners will be taught strategies to manage the behaviours of their clients and the communication tactics that can be used to work effectively with their clients in the process of supporting them on their job search and employment opportunities.  
  
**Module 3: Basic Counselling Skills & Practice for Job Coaches**  
  
This module will equip job coaches with basic counselling skills to help them work effectively with their clients. It will provide an overview of the counselling process, the different roles performed by the job coach-counsellor, basic counselling skills, goals of counselling, values and ethics in counselling and approaches in problem management. It will also cover the barriers affecting communication in the counselling process and the ways job coaches can prevent communication breakdowns.  
  
**Module 4: Introduction to Case Management**  
  
This module will equip job coaches with the necessary skills and knowledge pertaining to the practice of case management. It provides learners with a broad understanding of how case management serves as a means for achieving client wellness and autonomy through advocacy, dialogue, identification of service resources and direction. Additionally it also helps learners understand and view the connections between the job coach, the client, appropriate service personnel, and other stakeholders in order to optimise the assistance provided to their clients.  
  
**Module 5: Conflict, Leadership & People Management**  
  
This module will address the issues of potential conflicts that may arise in the workplace which would affect job coaches who work with the persons with disabilities, potential employers, caregivers and society at large. If conflict is not effectively managed and resolved, it can be detrimental because it could result in uncertainty, lowered morale and long-term working inefficiency and ineffectiveness. This module will discuss conflict resolution, the art of negotiation in order to reach an agreement between different stakeholders and how to apply these principles in leadership and people management.  
  
**Module 6: Client & Employer Engagement**  
  
This module focuses on job coaching for persons with disabilities within a supported employment framework. In contrast to the traditional ‘train and place’ approach, job coaching in supported employment embraces a ‘place, train, and sustain’ model. This model has proved to be significantly important for persons with disabilities to succeed in a job as it requires job coaches to work closely with clients with disabilities and employers throughout the job coaching process. Learners will be given opportunities through lectures, discussions, role plays and other hands-on activities to acquire the specific knowledge and skills required to engage and support clients and employers in supported employment. This process includes the development of client profiles, job development and placement, job site training and support how to effectively fade out of the coaching process and follow-up with the client.
