### Overview   
Are you facing challenges engaging staff?   
Do you find it difficult to develop leaders?   
Are you trying to create an healthier organisational culture?   
Are you struggling to manage conflicts in the workplace?   
Do you want to motivate millennials to realise their fullest potential?   

During this COVID-19 pandemic, with current social distancing measures and work-from-home (WFH) protocols, it is increasingly difficult to engage staff, create a healthier work culture, develop staff professionally and nurture their leadership potential.   

SSI and [Meta Consulting](https://meta.com.sg/){:target="_blank"} , a premier leadership development company, have created a tailor-made leadership development programme for the social service sector, using the [NEXLeaders.com](https://nexleaders.com/){:target="_blank"}    suite of mobile, micro-learning courses, powered by the Gnowbe learning platform.

This is a one-year initiative that was jointly developed to overcome social distancing barriers and work from home (WFH) challenges. NEXLeaders.com allows staff to learn on-the-go, anytime, anywhere through bite-size content, with a choice of more than 36 courses from industrial experts.   

### Target Audience
This programme is suitable for supervisors, first-line managers, middle management and senior management/directors in social service agencies (SSAs) and non-profit organisations (NPOs). Applicants who are not from SSAs or NPOs are also welcome to apply.  

### Course Details
The NEXLeaders Leadership Development Programme will commence on 11 Jan 2021.  

The courses are customised for three tiers in an organisation.
-   Supervisor/First-Line Manager.
-   Middle Management.
-   Senior Management/Director.

For a start, learners must complete five core modules within the first two and a half months (before 25 Mar 2021) before they can access the remaining 36 courses. The five core modules for each tier are as listed below.
