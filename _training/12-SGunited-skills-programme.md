## SGUnited Skills Programme

### Overview

The SGUnited skills (SGUS) Programme was launched by DPM Heng Swee Keat on 26 May 2020 to support an estimated 100,000 Singaporeans whose livelihoods have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through SGUS, job and traineeship opportunities will be provided to jobseekers to help them acquire the skillsets and capabilities needed to access expanded employment opportunities in both the private and public sector.

Over 40,000 jobs will be provided through this ‘Train-and-Place’ model and the courses under SGUS will be rolled out progressively from Jul 2020 till Dec 2020. All courses under the SGUS programme are modularised to be industry-relevant and certifiable and were designed in partnership with employers in the public and private sector. For learners who lack the basic skillsets required to access SGUS courses, bridging modules in basic literacy, numeracy, digital literacy and basic financial planning will be provided.

### How Do We Help?

If you are a Singaporean or a Singapore permanent resident who is a job seeker, we will equip you with the relevant skills to assume roles in the social service sector. Refer to the respective programmes for the entry requirement and the targeted job roles at the end of the programme.

Each programme will take around six to seven months to complete, this includes a three months internship period in a social service agency.  


You will also be receiving $1,200 per month as a training allowance if you maintain a 75% attendance during the six to seven months that the course occurs. Information on placement opportunities can be found through the social service dedicated job portal at this [link](https://www.ncss.gov.sg/Social-Servoce-Tribe/Careers/Careers-Guide){:target="_blank"}   .
