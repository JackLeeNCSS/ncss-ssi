## SkillsFuture Singapore Funding

### SSG Funding Principle

SSI is a CET Centre that offers Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) and non-WSQ courses at subsidised rates. Both Singaporeans and PRs are eligible for course subsidies. Employers can also tap on absentee payroll support funding for employer-sponsored training.
